##  2. A brief report

- Model structure：ConvNext（convnext_xlarge_384_in22ft1k）and SwinTransformer(swin_large_patch4_window12_384_in22k), with weights pretrained on ImageNet dataset。

- Ensemble methods：Two ConvNext at different epochs and one Swin-Transformer.

- Augmentation methods：HorizontalFlip、GaussNoise、GaussianBlur

- Data processing：A face detector MTCNN is used to crop the face images from video frame (enlarged the face region by a factor of 1.3). Resize the input shape to (3,384,384).

- Training losses：BCELoss

- The dataset used for training：FF++(c23 and c40)[1]/(DeepFake、Face2Face、FaceSwap、FaceShifter、NeuralTextures)、FF++(c23)/HifiFace[2]、UADFV[3]、DF-TIMIT[4]、DeeperForensics-1.0[5]、DeepFakeDection(c23 and c40)[6]、Celeb-DF[7]、WildDeepfake[8]、DFDC[9]

- **Tricks **：Don't use smaller size input、Early stop training、Larger model

## 3. Usage
  
### 3.1 Video frame extraction

- Extract a picture every 5 frames, and save the frame extraction results in the `data_picture` folder

```python
Video_frame_extraction.ipynb
```
### 3.2 Extract faces from `data_picture`

- Use face-recognition to detect face from one folder's different folders' images & save them in the `data_face` folder

```python
findfaceFR_folder.py
```
### 3.3 Train and predict the score of test1
- This solution uses only machine learning methods to "blind guess" from file name information. Specifically, the name of the video file is extracted and divided into segments, and a total of 5 features are extracted, and after feature encoding, they are sent to XGB for training. Use grid search to get the highest score of test1（0.7501, 0.7179）.

```python
test1_name_fea_xgb_grid.ipynb
```

### 3.4 Train and predict the score of test2

- The scheme uses the pre-processed face data in the `data_face` folder, each image has a size of 255*255, without resize, and directly trains it as a 196608-dimensional feature vector, using xgb with the original parameters to obtain the best test2 score (0.8610, 0.8850).

```python
test2_pic_xgb_mean.ipynb
```

### 3.5 Train and predict the score of test3
- The 340-dimensional feature vector was selected using the baseline scheme and combined with the 5 name features extracted from the test1 scheme to form a final 345-dimensional vector, which was modeled using XGB, and the results after grid search were fused with those of the baseline method (using fea340). The highest scoring test3 was obtained (0.5911, 0.6656).

```python
train_and_pred.py
test3_fea340+namefea_XGBr.ipynb
```
